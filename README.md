## ECE 6100 Advanced Computer Architecture: Predicted Branching

### Description
This repository contains the sumbitted project #2 for ECE 6100.  This project focused on implmenting (1) a Perceptron Branch predictor individually and (2) a complex branch predictor with a partner.  The second part of the project was also graded on a competitive basis, grading criteria such as how much storage was used and the rate of mispredictions in our method.  The results for our branch predictor ended being the 2nd best of the entire class.  A report details the nature of the complex predictor and it is accompanied by the source code developed in this project.
